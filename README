DHCP and DNS services with all config and data stored in etcd.  This
is intended to be a configurable all-in-one binary to run the core 
network services for a multi-site business network.  The configuration
is intended to be shared across all sites with per-site customization.

This is being used in production in a place where the missing bits are
acceptable to be missing, for now.  We're committed to adding loads of
functionality that is necessary for the production environment.

Patches and pull requests are gladly welcomed.


## What Works ##

* Most of DHCP, at least the critical parts
* Much of DNS, but not all record types
* DHCP leases update DNS; DNS records expire when DHCP leases expire
* DHCP config can be be set per-site and can have settings overridden
  on a per-host basis (by MAC address)
* DHCP leases can be reserved, as one would expect
* Can shut off DHCP service by not defining necessary DHCP host config
* DHCP only does IPv4 stuff, no IPv6 details at all
* DNS happily does AAAA records
* All services run on IPv4, but there's no reason it couldn't work for
  IPv6 too.


## TODO ##

* Explain how to configure it.  It really is easy, just not obvious.
* Tons.
* DHCP needs DHCPRELEASE, DHCPDECLINE
* DNS needs everything related to DNSSEC
* DNS needs more records supported
* We plan to provide some sort of UI as a separate project
* Allow admin to define a computer by wired and wireless adapters to
  allow prioritization of DNS registration to favor one network
  connection over another for the same device
* Allow for a device to be followed among various sites by keeping a
  defined DNS entry updated for the device


## Requires ##

* Functioning etcd system


## Plans ##

* Provide simple SMTP service for store-and-forward.
* Determine other services that would make sense to provide here
  without being "for the sake of monolitic systems".
